# Turtle-crossing-game
The Turtle Crossing Game.
This is the capstone project of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp for 2022.
I wrote this project from scratch.
The game is simple. The player needs to move the turtle, which only goes forward, across the street filled with cars.
Once the turtle crosses the finishing line, the level will increase, and the speed of the cars will also increase.
